To design a system that helps a bank manager handle queues in a banking hall effectively, we can use **queueing theory** principles, particularly the **M/M/1 queue** model. This model assumes:

1. A single server (e.g., one teller at the bank counter).
2. Exponentially distributed inter-arrival times (Poisson arrival process).
3. Exponentially distributed service times.
4. First-come, first-served (FCFS) discipline.

Here's how the system can be designed and evaluated:

---

### 1. **Queueing Model Design**
- **Input Parameters:**
  - Arrival rate (\(\lambda\)): Average number of customers arriving per unit time.
  - Service rate (\(\mu\)): Average number of customers served per unit time.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Utilization Factor (\(\rho\)):** \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\)
  - **Average number of customers in the system (\(L\)):**
    \(L = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}\)
  - **Average number of customers in the queue (\(L_q\)):**
    \(L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1 - \rho}\)
  - **Average time a customer spends in the system (\(W\)):**
    \(W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}\)
  - **Average time a customer spends waiting in the queue (\(W_q\)):**
    \(W_q = \frac{\rho}{\mu - \lambda}\)

---

### 2. **Improvement Strategies**
- **Add More Servers:** Transition to an M/M/c model (multiple servers).
- **Change Service Priorities:** Implement separate queues for different services.
- **Redirect Traffic:** Introduce automated kiosks or digital services to handle routine tasks.

---

### 3. **Simulation and Visualization**
We'll simulate the M/M/1 queue for varying arrival and service rates to see its performance under different conditions. Letâ€™s calculate and plot:

1. **Utilization Factor (\(\rho\))** vs. \(\lambda\).
2. Average **queue length** and **waiting time** under different conditions.
3. Impact of adding additional servers (comparison to M/M/c).

Let me calculate and create the necessary plots for this analysis.

Here are the visualizations for the M/M/1 queue system:

1. **Utilization Factor vs. Arrival Rate**: Shows how the utilization factor (\(\rho\)) increases with the arrival rate (\(\lambda\)). A \(\rho\) close to 1 indicates the system is highly utilized and prone to congestion.

2. **Queue Metrics**:
   - Average number of customers in the system (\(L\)).
   - Average number of customers in the queue (\(L_q\)).
   As \(\lambda\) approaches \(\mu\), both \(L\) and \(L_q\) increase sharply, demonstrating potential inefficiency under high load.

3. **Time Metrics**:
   - Average time in the system (\(W\)).
   - Average time in the queue (\(W_q\)).
   These also grow significantly as \(\lambda\) approaches \(\mu\), indicating prolonged waiting times for customers.

### Insights:
- **High Utilization (\(\rho > 0.8\))**: Results in large queue sizes and long waiting times, suggesting the need for additional resources (e.g., more servers or better scheduling).
- **Adding Servers (M/M/c)**: Could improve performance by distributing the load.
